                    <p> Music is an art form, and cultural activity, whose 
                        medium is sound. General definitions of music 
                        include common elements such as pitch (which 
                        governs melody and harmony), rhythm (and its 
                        associated concepts tempo, meter, and articulation), 
                        dynamics (loudness and softness), and the sonic q
                        ualities of timbre and texture (which are sometimes 
                        termed the "color" of a musical sound). Different
                        styles or types of music may emphasize, de-emphasize
                        or omit some of these elements. Music is performed 
                        with a vast range of instruments and vocal techniques 
                        ranging from singing to rapping; there are solely 
                        instrumental pieces, solely vocal pieces (such as songs 
                        without instrumental accompaniment) and pieces that 
                        combine singing and instruments.
