        <p>Music is an art form, and cultural activity, whose 
            medium is sound. General definitions of music 
            include common elements such as pitch (which 
            governs melody and harmony), rhythm (and its 
            associated concepts tempo, meter, and articulation), 
            dynamics (loudness and softness), and the sonic q
            ualities of timbre and texture (which are sometimes 
            termed the "color" of a musical sound). Different
            styles or types of music may emphasize, de-emphasize
            or omit some of these elements. Music is performed 
            with a vast range of instruments and vocal techniques 
            ranging from singing to rapping; there are solely 
            instrumental pieces, solely vocal pieces (such as songs 
            without instrumental accompaniment) and pieces that 
            combine singing and instruments.

        <p>Music can be divided into genres (e.g., country music)
             and genres can be further divided into subgenres 
             (e.g., country blues and pop country are two of the
              many country subgenres), although the dividing lines 
              and relationships between music genres are often 
              subtle, sometimes open to personal interpretation, 
              and occasionally controversial. For example, it can 
              be hard to draw the line between some early 1980s hard
               rock and heavy metal. Within the arts, music may be 
               classified as a performing art, a fine art or as an 
               auditory art. Music may be played or sung and heard 
               live at a rock concert or orchestra performance, heard 
               live as part of a dramatic work (a music theater show or
                opera), or it may be recorded and listened to on a radio, 
                MP3 player, CD player, smartphone or as film score or TV 
                show.
